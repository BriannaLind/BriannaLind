## Brianna Lind, PhD

Hi my name is Bri (like the cheese)! I am a dryland ecologist with a passion for termite mounds, multiscale interactions, and geospatial science.  I like to use use a combination of field works, modeling, and remote sensing to explore research questions.  I am passionate about open science and love teaching others about ecology, remote sensing, science, science writing, and geography.
